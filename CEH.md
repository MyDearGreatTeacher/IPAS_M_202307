# 試題類型
### 試題類型1.資安情境敘述 ==> 問是何種攻擊? 何種技術?
```
While performing online banking using a Web browser, a user receives an email that contains a link to an
interesting Web site. When the user clicks on the link, another Web browser session starts and displays a
video of cats playing a piano. The next business day, the user receives what looks like an email from his bank,
indicating that his bank account has been accessed from a foreign country. The email asks the user to call his
bank and verify the authorization of a funds transfer that took place. What Web browser-based security
vulnerability was exploited to compromise the user?
A. Clickjacking
B. Cross-Site Scripting
C. Cross-Site Request Forgery
D. Web form input validation

C
```

```
Identify the web application attack where the attackers exploit vulnerabilities in dynamically generated web
pages to inject client-side script into web pages viewed by other users.
A. LDAP Injection attack
B. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
C. SQL injection attack
D. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

B
```
```
You are tasked to perform a penetration test. While you are performing information gathering, you find an
employee list in Google. You find the receptionist’s email, and you send her an email changing the source
email to her boss’s email (boss@company). In this email, you ask for a pdf with information. She reads your
email and sends back a pdf with links. You exchange the pdf links with your malicious links (these links contain
malware) and send back the modified pdf, saying that the links don’t work. She reads your email, opens the
links, and her machine gets infected. You now have access to the company network. What testing method did
you use?
A. Social engineering       B. Piggybacking    C. Tailgating    D. Eavesdropping
A
```

```
“........is an attack type for a rogue Wi-Fi access point that appears to be a legitimate one offered on the
premises, but actually has been set up to eavesdrop on wireless communications. It is the wireless version of
the phishing scam. An attacker fools wireless users into connecting a laptop or mobile phone to a tainted
hotspot by posing as a legitimate provider. This type of attack may be used to steal the passwords of
unsuspecting users by either snooping the communication link or by phishing, which involves setting up a
fraudulent web site and luring people there.”
Fill in the blank with appropriate choice.
A. Evil Twin Attack    B. Sinkhole Attack     C. Collision Attack   D. Signal Jamming Attack

A
```

```
You are working as a Security Analyst in a company XYZ that owns the whole subnet range of 23.0.0.0/8 and
192.168.0.0/8.
While monitoring the data, you find a high number of outbound connections. You see that IP’s owned by XYZ
(Internal) and private IP’s are communicating to a Single Public IP. Therefore, the Internal IP’s are sending
data to the Public IP.
After further analysis, you find out that this Public IP is a blacklisted IP, and the internal communicating devices
are compromised.
What kind of attack does the above scenario depict?
A. Botnet Attack
B. Spear Phishing Attack
C. Advanced Persistent Threats
D. Rootkit Attack

A

```
```
Scenario:
1. Victim opens the attacker’s web site.
2. Attacker sets up a web site which contains interesting and attractive content like ‘Do you want to make $1000 in a day?’.
3. Victim clicks to the interesting and attractive content URL.
4. Attacker creates a transparent ‘iframe’ in front of the URL which the victim attempts to click, so the victim
thinks that he/she clicks on the ‘Do you want to make $1000 in a day?’ URL but actually he/she clicks on the
content or URL that exists in the transparent 'iframe' which is setup by the attacker.

What is the name of the attack which is mentioned in the scenario?
A. Session Fixation
B. HTML Injection
C. HTTP Parameter Pollution
D. Clickjacking Attack

D
```

```
An attacker is trying to redirect the traffic of a small office. That office is using their own mail server, DNS
server and NTP server because of the importance of their job. The attacker gain access to the DNS server and

to Google they are being redirected to the attacker machine. What is the name of this kind of attack?
A. MAC Flooding
B. Smurf Attack
C. DNS spoofing
D. ARP Poisoning

C
```

```
The collection of potentially actionable, overt, and publicly available information is known as

C. Replay attack
D. Traffic analysis attack
