- Risk Frameworks風險管理框架 
  - NIST Risk Management Framework(RMF) 
    - 風險管理框架提供了一個將安全、隱私和網絡供應鏈風險管理活動集成到系統開發生命週期中的過程。
    - 基於風險的控制選擇和規範方法考慮了適用法律、指令、行政命令、政策、標准或法規的有效性、效率和約束。
    - 管理組織風險對於有效的信息安全和隱私計劃至關重要
    - RMF 方法可以應用於新系統和遺留系統、任何類型的系統或技術（例如物聯網、控制系統），以及任何類型的組織，無論其規模或行業如何 
    - NIST Risk Management Framework 7階段:
      - 1.prepare準備階段 == > 組織管理安全和隱私風險的 基本活動Essential activities to prepare the organization to manage security and privacy risks
      - 2.Categorize分類階段 == > 根據影響分析對處理、存儲和傳輸的系統和信息進行分類
      - 3.Select選擇階段 == > 選擇一組 NIST SP 800-53 控件以根據風險評估保護系統
      - 4.Implement實施階段 == > 實施控制並記錄如何部署控制
      - 5.Assess評估階段 == >評估以確定控制是否到位、是否按預期運行並產生預期結果
      - 6.authorize授權階段 == >高級官員(Senior official)基於風險做出授權系統（運行）的決定
      - 7.monitor 監控階段 == >持續監控系統的控制實施和風險
  - ISO/IEC 27005 
  - OCTAVE Framework 
    - OCTAVE® == Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability EvaluationSM 
    - Carnegie Mellon University, SEI (Software Engineering Institute)
    - OCTAVE is a risk assessment methodology to identify, manage and evaluate information security risks
    - OCTAVE® defines a risk-based strategic assessment and planning technique for security. 
    - OCTAVE is a self-directed approach, meaning that people from an organization assume responsibility for setting the organization's security strategy.
