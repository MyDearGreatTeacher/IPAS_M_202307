- Risk Frameworks風險管理框架 
  - NIST Risk Management Framework(RMF) 
    - 風險管理框架提供了一個將安全、隱私和網絡供應鏈風險管理活動集成到系統開發生命週期中的過程。
    - 基於風險的控制選擇和規範方法考慮了適用法律、指令、行政命令、政策、標准或法規的有效性、效率和約束。
    - 管理組織風險對於有效的信息安全和隱私計劃至關重要
    - RMF 方法可以應用於新系統和遺留系統、任何類型的系統或技術（例如物聯網、控制系統），以及任何類型的組織，無論其規模或行業如何 
  - ISO/IEC 27005 
  - OCTAVE Framework 
    - OCTAVE® == Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability EvaluationSM 
    - Carnegie Mellon University, SEI (Software Engineering Institute)
    - OCTAVE is a risk assessment methodology to identify, manage and evaluate information security risks
    - OCTAVE® defines a risk-based strategic assessment and planning technique for security. 
    - OCTAVE is a self-directed approach, meaning that people from an organization assume responsibility for setting the organization's security strategy.
