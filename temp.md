ID.AM-1: Physical devices and systems within the organization are inventoried





ID.AM-2: Software platforms and applications within the organization are inventoried





ID.AM-3: Organizational communication and data flows are mapped




ID.AM-4: External information systems are catalogued



ID.AM-5: Resources (e.g., hardware, devices, data, time, personnel, and software) are prioritized based on their classification, criticality, and business value 




ID.AM-6: Cybersecurity roles and responsibilities for the entire workforce and third-party stakeholders (e.g., suppliers, customers, partners) are established







Bell-LaPadula Model 

This is the first mathematical model of a multilevel security
policy that defines the concept of a secure state and necessary modes of access.
It ensures that information only flows in a manner that does not violate the system
policy and is confidentiality focused.

• The simple security rule A subject cannot read data within an object that
resides at a higher security level (no read up).
• The *-property rule A subject cannot write to an object at a lower security
level (no write down).
• The strong star property rule For a subject to be able to read and write to an object, the subject’s clearance and the object’s classification must be equal.

Biba Model 

A model that describes a set of access control rules designed to ensure
data integrity.

• The simple integrity axiom A subject cannot read data at a lower integrity
level (no read down).
• The *-integrity axiom A subject cannot modify an object at a higher
integrity level (no write up).
Clark-Wilson Model This integrity model is implemented to protect the integrity
of data and to ensure that properly formatted transactions take place. It addresses
all three goals of integrity:
• Subjects can access objects only through authorized programs (access triple).
• Separation of duties is enforced.
• Auditing is required.

Noninterference Model 

This formal multilevel security model states that
commands and activities performed at one security level should not be seen by, or
affect, subjects or objects at a different security level.

Brewer and Nash Model 

This model allows for dynamically changing access controls
that protect against conflicts of interest. Also known as the Chinese Wall model.

Graham-Denning Model 

This model shows how subjects and objects should be
created and deleted. It also addresses how to assign specific access rights.

Harrison-Ruzzo-Ullman Model 

This model shows how a finite set of procedures
can be available to edit the access rights of a subject.



Business Continuity Plan (BCP)

Provides procedures for sustaining mission/business operations while recovering from a significant disruption.

Addresses mission/business processes at a lower or expanded level from COOP MEFs.

Mission/business process focused plan that may be activated in coordination with a COOP plan to sustain non-MEFs.

Continuity of Operations (COOP) Plan

Provides procedures and guidance to sustain an organization’s MEFs at an alternate site for up to 30 days; mandated by federal directives.

Addresses MEFs at a facility;

information systems are addressed based only on their support of the mission essential functions.
MEF focused plan that
may also activate several
business unit-level BCPs,
ISCPs, or DRPs, as
appropriate.

Crisis Communications Plan

Provides procedures for disseminating internal and external communications;

means to provide critical status information and control rumors.

Addresses communications with personnel and the public; not information systemfocused.

Incident-based plan often activated with a COOP or
BCP, but may be used
alone during a public
exposure event.

Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) Plan

Provides policies and procedures for protection of national critical infrastructure
components, as defined in the National Infrastructure Protection Plan.

Addresses critical infrastructure components that are supported or operated by an agency or organization.

Risk management plan
that supports COOP
plans for organizations
with critical infrastructure
and key resource assets.

Cyber Incident Response Plan

Provides procedures for mitigating and correcting a cyber attack, such as a virus, worm, or Trojan horse.
Addresses mitigation and isolation of affected systems,
cleanup, and minimizing loss of information.
Information systemfocused plan that may
activate an ISCP or DRP,
depending on the extent
of the attack.


Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)

Provides procedures for relocating information systems operations to an alternate location.

Activated after major system disruptions with long-term effects.

Information systemfocused plan that activates one or more ISCPs for recovery of individual systems.

Information System Contingency Plan (ISCP)

Provides procedures and capabilities for recovering an information system.

Addresses single information system recovery at the
current or, if appropriate
alternate location.

Information systemfocused plan that may be
activated independent
from other plans or as
part of a larger recovery
effort coordinated with a
DRP, COOP, and/or
BCP.

Occupant Emergency Plan (OEP)

Provides coordinated procedures for minimizing loss of life or injury and
protecting property damage in response to a physical threat.

Focuses on personnel and property particular to the specific facility; not
mission/business process or information system-based.

Incident-based plan that is initiated immediately after an event, preceding a COOP or DRP activation.
